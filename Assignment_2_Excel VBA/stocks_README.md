#   Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the project was to analyze the various stocks within the data to determine their perfomance for the years 2017 and 2018 to help make well-informed decisions on investment choices


#   Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

For the year 2017, all the stocks analyzed with the exception of ticker "TERP" had a positive performance while for the year 2018,  all the stocks analyzed with the exception of tickers "ENPH" and "RUN" had a negative performance year.

The pictures and analysis times are included in the word file.


#   Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
#    What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#    How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

To sum it up, an advantage of refactoring code is that it saves time of writing the entire code from scratch and a disadvantage will be it can be difficult to debug when you run into issues with the code.

These pro and con realized an efficient run time of the refactored code relative to the original VCA script and we only had to code a few lines which saved some time. I did run into some debugging issues which too some time to figure out what was wrong with my code.
