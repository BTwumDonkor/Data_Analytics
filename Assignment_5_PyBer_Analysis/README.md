# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
-> The purpose of this analysis is to provide a a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by the various city types ( urban, suburban and rural). Also to narrow down to the weekly trends of the total fares within  the various city types over the first four months period of the year.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

-> From the results of the summary dataframe, it was observed that Urban cities recorded the most ride-sharing trips of 1,625 and with total drivers of 2405, followed by suburban cities with the rural cities recording the least. However, yural fares were higher and rural drivers earned more relative to suburban and the urban cities having the lowest rates. The total fares correlates with the total rides data given that urban cities recorded the highes total rides followed by suburban and rural being the least in this regard.

-> The weekly total fare by city type chart reveals the fares peaking around the forth week in February for all city types. Suburban total fares tend to peak again during the last week of April. Otherwise the total fares within each city type tends to show less variation with the total fares of urban cities being on an upward trend.


Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
-> Running promotions such as discount fares can be encouraged in suburban and rural cities especially to boost demand for ride-sharing.
-> Data might be reflective of population influences in the various city types as such a corresponding increase in total drivers by incentivising them to accomodate the increase in demand for ride-sharing within suburban and rural cities.
-> Running referral programs and competitive pay structures and working conditions can also help address the disparities among the city types.
